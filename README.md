# Bridge2AI ðŸš§ðŸš§
This API is a solution for developers who want to use [OpenAI's](https://platform.openai.com/overview) text and image generation technology in their applications. With multiple endpoints available, it is possible to generate text, images, and edit images using specific prompts and models.

## How to use
To use this API, it is necessary to send an HTTP request to one of the available endpoints, providing the necessary inputs for text or image generation. It is important to note that the API performs validations to ensure that the inputs are valid before sending requests to OpenAI to ensure accurate and relevant responses.

Please include that to use the API, the user needs to add the API key generated on the OpenAI website, and the billing is based on usage, but it is very affordable compared to the rate set by the "plus" of [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/chat).

## API Documentation



```http
  POST /completion
```

#### Returns a text generated by the OpenAI API based on the provided prompt.

### Request Body

| Parameter   | Type       | Description                                   |
| :---------- | :--------- | :------------------------------------------ |
| `prompt`      | `string` | 	A string representing the prompt to generate text completion for.|


### Query Parameters

| Parameter   | Type       | Description                                   |
| :---------- | :--------- | :------------------------------------------ |
| `max_tokens`      | `integer` | 	The maximum number of tokens to generate. Defaults to 50.|
| `temperature`      | `float` |A number from 0 to 1 that determines the 'creativity level' of the generated text. The closer to 0, the more conservative the text will be. The closer to 1, the more creative and unpredictable the text will be. Default: 0.|


```http
  POST /image
```

#### Returns an image based on prompt

### Request Body

| Parameter   | Type       | Description                                   |
| :---------- | :--------- | :------------------------------------------ |
| `prompt`      | `string` | 	A string representing the prompt to generate image|


### Query Parameters

| Parameter   | Type       | Description                                   |
| :---------- | :--------- | :------------------------------------------ |
| `n`      | `integer` | 	 Number of generated outputs. Defaults to 1.|
| `size`      | `string` | The size of the output image. It must be in the format "width x height". Defaults to "256x256".|


```http
  POST /image-edit
```
#### The user uploads an input image file and a binary mask file that defines which areas of the input image should be edited. The API will then generate an edited output image file based on the input image and mask.

### Request Body

| Parameter   | Type       | Description                                   |
| :---------- | :--------- | :------------------------------------------ |
| `inputImage`      | `file` | 	The input image to be edited.|
| `mask`      | `file` | 	A binary image that defines the area of the input image to be edited. Where pixel value 0 represents pixels that should not be edited and pixel value 1 represents pixels that should be edited.|
| `prompt`      | `string` | Optional string that can be used to provide additional instructions for the image editing.|
| `n`      | `integer` | Number of generated outputs. Defaults to 1.|
| `size`      | `string` | The size of the output image. It must be in the format "width x height". Defaults to "256x256".|


```http
  POST /authenticate
```
#### This endpoint is used to authenticate users by checking their provided username and password against stored credentials. The endpoint expects a POST request with a JSON payload containing the username and password.

If the username and password match the stored credentials, the server generates a JSON Web Token (JWT) for the user and returns it in the response.

This endpoint allows users to log in to the application by verifying their identity with a username and password.

### Request Body

| Parameter   | Type       | Description                                   |
| :---------- | :--------- | :------------------------------------------ |
| `username`      | `string` | 	user credential |
| `password`      | `string` | 	password credential|


### Conclusion
Bridge2AI is a powerful and secure tool for interacting with OpenAI's generation API. With text, image, and image editing endpoints available, it is possible to explore the possibilities offered by OpenAI and create innovative and impressive applications.
